## Install

This project uses 
[jax-relax](https://github.com/BirkhoffG/ReLax/tree/master) (a fast and scalable recourse explanation library).
Ths library is highly scalable and extensible, which enables our experiments to be finished within 30 minutes.
In contrast, a pytorch implementation of RoCourseNet takes around 12 hours to run.

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]" --upgrade
```

## Run Experiments

Running `scripts.experiment.py` with different arguments will reproduce results in our paper. For example,

1. Train and Evaluate RoCourseNet on Loan Application Dataset:

```sh
python -m scripts.experiment.py -d loan
```

2. Train and Evaluate CounterNet on Loan Application Dataset:

```sh
python -m scripts.experiment.py -m CounterNet -d loan
```

3. Train and Evaluate ROAR on Loan Application Dataset:

```sh
python -m scripts.experiment.py -m ROAR -d loan
```
